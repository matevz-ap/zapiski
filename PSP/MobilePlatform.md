# Mobile Platform Programming
Characterised by:
- personal use
- highly reliant on user interaction
- context awarness (sensors and machine learning)

## Challenges
### Energy
- no large batterias, no connection to charger
- energy spent on: computation, display, sesnsing, communication

### Processing constraints
- app gets only a small share of total resources

### User interaction constraints
- interaction should be intuitive and responsive despite limited computation resources, small touchscreens, lack of keyboards

### Uniform user experience
- supporting a range of devices that differ by hardware/software

### Wireless constraints
- earth not fully covered with wireless (working offline)
- connectivity quality varies in space and time
- high mobility impacts wireless connectivity
- throughput vs avaulavility vs cost vs energy efficiency

### Context sensing challenges
- mobile sensors not envisioned as frequently used features
- the accuracy of sensors can be low and inconsistent
- raw data needs to be processed before we can infer high-level concepts (possible misclassification)

### Security and privacy 
- physical (lost or stolen devices)
- wireless (eavesdropping, need for encrypted)
- third party privacy in mobile sensing
- bugs (OS, leaked data)


## Understand the users
- indetify your target audience
- interaction needs to be intuitive
- user patience is limited:
    - you have only one try
    - stress test before shipping
